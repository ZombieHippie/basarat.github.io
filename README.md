# About
That guy you probably know because you heard something about TypeScript.

## Books
### Beginning NodeJS
Published by [Apress](http://www.apress.com/9781484201886) and [available on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Node-js-Basarat-Ali-Syed/dp/1484201884). A year worth of effort went into this ... but was totally worth it :rose:

### TypeScript Deep Dive
Due to my extensive work with the TypeScript community there were thoughts that I wanted to share on the subject. I collated them in to [an open source book called TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/getting-started.html). Ofcourse its the [number one google result for TypeScript book](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=typescript+book). I've also reviewed [many](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-typescript) -- [other](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/typescript-essentials) TypeScript books and would be happy to review a chapter if you want me to.

## Active Projects
Current Pet Projects

## Other Projects

Too many, but here are a few I still feel proud about

* [TypeScript Collections](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-collections) : A data structures library for TypeScript.
* [NTypeScript](https://github.com/typestrong/ntypescript) : Making it easier to consume the latest and greatest stuff from the TypeScript team.
* [grunt-ts](https://github.com/typestrong/grunt-ts) : Other great people own this now. It allowed me to be productive with TypeScript in any IDE back when the LangaugeService wasn't well documented.
* [CSX](https://github.com/basarat/csx) : CSS FlexBox done in JS variables.

## Presenter
* [YouTube](http://youtube.com/basaratali) : Haven't published something new for a year, but still have 500 subscribers and some videos with 15K views, which isn't bad for developer focused channel.
* Meetups : Done this [many](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/115068682/) -- [times](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/123024172/) -- [at](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/105244942/) -- [many](http://lanyrd.com/2015/decompressau/) -- [events](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Melbourne/events/221359461/).
