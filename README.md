## Active Projects
Current Pet Projects

## Other Projects

Too many, but here are a few I still feel proud about

* [TypeScript Collections](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-collections) : A data structures library for TypeScript.
* [NTypeScript](https://github.com/typestrong/ntypescript) : Making it easier to consume the latest and greatest stuff from the TypeScript team.
* [grunt-ts](https://github.com/typestrong/grunt-ts) : Other great people own this now. It allowed me to be productive with TypeScript in any IDE back when the LangaugeService wasn't well documented.
* [CSX](https://github.com/basarat/csx) : CSS FlexBox done in JS variables.

## Presenter
