## Beginning NodeJS
Published by [Apress](http://www.apress.com/9781484201886) and [available on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Node-js-Basarat-Ali-Syed/dp/1484201884). A year worth of effort went into this ... but was totally worth it :rose:

## TypeScript Deep Dive
Due to my extensive work with the TypeScript community there were thoughts that I wanted to share on the subject. I collated them in to [an open source book called TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/getting-started.html). Ofcourse its the [number one google result for TypeScript book](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=typescript+book).

## Others
I've also reviewed [many](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-typescript) -- [other](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/typescript-essentials) TypeScript books and would be happy to review a chapter if you want me to.
