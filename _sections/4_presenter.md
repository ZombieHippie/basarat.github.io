Done this [many](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/115068682/) -- [times](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/123024172/) -- [at](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/events/105244942/) -- [many](http://lanyrd.com/2015/decompressau/) -- [events](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Melbourne/events/221359461/). Would be happy to do a talk [if you want me to](https://twitter.com/basarat). Otherwise I'm mostly busy creating or helping others with OSS projects.

Also [YouTube](http://youtube.com/basaratali) : Haven't published something new for a year, but still have 500 subscribers and some videos with 15K+ views, which isn't bad for developer focused channel.
